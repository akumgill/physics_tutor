q1.h3,kc3,"Focusing our attention in the vertical direction, we know the initial velocity, \(v_{0,y}\), and the final velocity, \(v_{f,y}\), when the dolphin is passing through the hoop at the maximum height. You also know that the acceleration is due to gravity, i.e. \(a_y = -g\). Which equation of motion would you like to use to solve the problem? Note that there is more than one acceptable answer.",no_img
