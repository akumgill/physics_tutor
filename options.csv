q5.h3.o5,Normal force is parallel to the y-axis and doesn't affect other components.,FALSE,Incorrect. Normal force counters the perpendicular component of gravity.
q5.h4_1.o1,"At location 1, the net acceleration is in the positive y direction.",FALSE,"Incorrect. At location 1, gravity acts downward, and causes acceleration down the plane."
q5.h4_1.o2,"At location 2, the component of gravity in the +y direction is zero, so net acceleration is not positive y.",TRUE,"Correct! At the top of the ramp at location 2, there is no component in the positive y direction; it's balanced."
q5.h4_1.o3,"At location 3, the net acceleration can have a positive y component because it's going down the plane.",FALSE,Incorrect. The net force down the ramp isn't aligned with the positive y direction.
q5.h4_1.o4,All locations experience a net force along the positive y direction.,FALSE,"Incorrect, evaluate each location's net force based on gravity."
q5.h4_1.o5,There is no acceleration impacted y-wise at any location on a frictionless ramp.,FALSE,"Gravity acts at each point, but only specific orientations affect y-alignment."
